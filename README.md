# 📊 Bank Customer Churn Analysis  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn in the banking sector**. Customer churn refers to when clients stop using the bank’s services. The goal of this project is to identify the key factors that contribute to churn and to build models that can predict whether a customer is likely to leave.  

By understanding these drivers, banks can take proactive measures to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore and clean the customer dataset.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify churn patterns.  
- Apply **data visualization** to highlight key insights.  
- Build and evaluate **predictive models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify churn.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn.
